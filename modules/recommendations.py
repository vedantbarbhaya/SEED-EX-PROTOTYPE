        The data shows significant gaps in environmental disclosure, with inconsistent reporting across companies and industries.
        
        #### Recommendations
        - **Standardize Environmental Philanthropy Reporting**: Develop consistent reporting frameworks that all publicly traded companies must follow
        - **Mandate Giving Transparency**: Require detailed disclosure of environmental charitable giving, including recipient information and purpose
        - **Require Impact Assessment**: Companies should report the intended and actual impact of their environmental philanthropy
        
        #### Implementation
        - Update SEC filing requirements to include standardized environmental philanthropy sections
